Problem

A sequence of integers is said to be beautiful if the bitwise AND, OR, and XOR of its elements are pairwise equal to each other.

You are given a sequence A of size N. Find the number of non-empty subsequences of A that are beautiful. Print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input format

The first line contains an integer N representing the number of elements in the sequence.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ...., AN, representing the sequence.

Output format

In a single line, print the number of non-empty subsequences of A that are beautiful.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 2.10^5
0 <= Ai <= 10^9

Explanation
Here the subsequence {A1, A3, A5} is not beautiful. This is because:

    A1 & A3 & A5 = 1 & 2 & 2 = 0
    A1 | A3 | A5 = 1 | 2 | 2 = 3
    A1 ^ A3 ^ A5 = 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 = 1

For a subsequence to be beautiful, these three values should be equal to each other.

 & represents bitwise AND 
 | represents bitwise OR 
 ^ represents bitwise XOR
